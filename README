This package contains a class and script to execute a proxy requests from AJAX
 scripts. If this proxy.php was live on a server at example.com/proxy.php, and we
 wanted to make AJAX requests to subdomain.example.com/other/resource, we'd:

     1. Add lines at the bottom of this file to say
         $proxy = new Proxy('http://subdomain.example.com');
         $proxy->execute();
     2. From our javascript, make requests to
         http://example.com/proxy.php?route=/other/resource

Also included is a set of PHP-docs with detailed documentation in case it's
 needed.
